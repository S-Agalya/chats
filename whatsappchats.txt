13/01/24, 20:01 - +91 91503 09268: The Apple Vision Pro is coming out in Feb.

1. Is anyone getting it?
2. What is the primary use case that you envisage for it, that cannot be done with an occulus?
14/01/24, 07:20 - +91 90030 79801: At $3.5k price point, I could see premium gaming as the main use case. Industrial use cases like shared designing of 3D structures makes sense...
14/01/24, 07:21 - +91 91503 09268: The problem is the weight - glass + metal and battery life (around 2 hours).
14/01/24, 07:21 - +91 90030 79801: exactly...
14/01/24, 07:22 - +91 90030 79801: Zuck didn't think as a big competition as well.. he had said they haven't done anything out of expectations
14/01/24, 07:23 - +91 90030 79801: I was blown away by one aspect of it.... they could predict where the user is going to click before actually clicking
14/01/24, 07:36 - +91 98840 20395: I wanted to buy. I am waiting for reviews from users before buying. Would like to try it out before buying that would be ideal. I am sure some guy in YouTube is going to post a video about how he is using it as multi monitor setup for software development. It will be my initial personal use case. 

Virtual reality is good. Large screen tv and 3D viewing of sports events. I guess we will be watching IPL soon in 3D. Theatre like watching experience of Netflix and more. 

I think augmented reality is going to the greatest selling point. Searching for misplaced stuff at home along with object identification. Apple is sitting on a lot of ai related compute in their recent processors.

Found it quite interesting. What do doctors / experts in the medical field think of this?
14/01/24, 13:00 - +91 91503 09268: I was looking for you to tag and then realized you are the one asking üòÖ
14/01/24, 13:00 - +91 91503 09268: There is always a 1% of the population which will help themselves. The rest all need service.
14/01/24, 13:01 - +91 91503 09268: Self initiation, follow up, monitoring, guidance, interventions - all of these are services that 99% cant live without, i feel.
14/01/24, 13:02 - +91 91503 09268: Do look up "Quantified self". Over the past few years, quite a few people are meticulously monitoring themselves. Even though all of that data is openly available and so are the tools and tech, less than 2% of people in India regularly exercise üòÖ.  This is a subset of a subset or a subset or a subsect sort of market. The rest will all need doctors (who will have AI companions)

14/01/24, 23:40 - +91 98945 98982: I don't know about doctors, but as a family/friend of a victim, I vouch that a solution which can take the diagnosis report and suggest a best course of action would have helped a lot. Not a mere prompt. 
--------------------
Case 1 : My dad had end stage liver failure due to NASH and was admitted in the ERD of a Greek God hospital. 
It was a shock for the family. The doctor's approach was more fear mongering rather than educating. Even when we asked genuine questions about prognosis, what to eat, and what lifestyle changes had to be inculcated, their response was like "please don't Google and ask us these questions. Just do what we say." 
They gave no practical inputs for prognosis management. I was fortunate to have two amazing doctor friends who made us understand the gravity of the situation, counsel my family on the red/green scenarios and also suggest the options we had. 
We had to enroll for a liver transplant at earliest and radically transform the eating habits,  bring in more physical activities and get a lot of precautionary vaccinations administered to support a weakened immune system. None of this was suggested by the hospital/doctors/dietician.

Case 2: Alcoholic friend of mine admitted in ERD of a multi speciality clinic due to a binge episode resulting in pancreatitis. He almost entered the doorways of heaven.

He was stabilized after a couple of days. His mom was the only attendant and they asked her to bring home cooked food.

In order to speed up recovery from pancreatitis, a patient should stick to a liquid diet for a week or two to reduce the strain on the inflamed pancreas. No such advice was given and this lady went home to prepare Rasam, Curd rice along with Pomegranate juice(with milk) which ended up inflaming the pancreas severely.

Complicating it further, this guy was undergoing withdrawal symptoms and throwing tantrums. The doctors didn't correlate this p.o.v. A simple nicotine patch would have eased this mental strain.

When his mom called me, I asked her to request the  visiting doctor to administer a nicotine patch, continue treatment for a couple of days, stick to liquid food, get out of the hell hole and check in to the Greek God hospital as they had a slightly better approach. They addressed the withdrawal symptoms, gave holistic treatment with psychiatric intervention. + They had food options which considered the ailment.
------------------------
I am pretty sure that the above cases are not unique in this money minded healthcare system which tries to fill up empty beds as quickly as possible. There are no standards/governance either.

In Patrick's case, he was well versed with how to use a LLM, have a pro version and also knew how to query avoiding hallucinations.

It would be great if there is a doctor bot which provides the right diagnostic suggestions, follow it up with interventions based on the results and suggests the nearest healthcare system which can be approached. <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 10:02 - +91 6355 762 814: Thanks for a detailed revert. So in summary, an AI bot will be of value. It could be for self-diagnosis, or as clinical-decision-support system for doctors.

19/01/24, 12:36 - +91 99707 90627: Introductory price is $299
19/01/24, 13:43 - +91 91503 09268: We are good with WA for now üòÖüôèüèΩ
19/01/24, 14:13 - +91 91503 09268: I am a big believer in figure out the underlying value prop before you mess around with the platform. WA is low friction and is free, and enables us to validate the core value prop. Everything else can wait. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
19/01/24, 14:33 - +91 99707 90627: Sure, just came across it and thought it would be useful. The pricing strategy is also pretty unique in this day and age
19/01/24, 14:40 - +91 91503 09268: This was the model before the SaaS craze kicked in üòÖ
19/01/24, 14:41 - +91 99707 90627: Yes I‚Äôm old enough to remember those days. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
19/01/24, 15:09 - +91 91503 09268: Since this is a learning space, sharing some perspective since there are several others looking at community based models.

1. Like I said, I am a strong believer in keeping friction low, onboarding users (with some curation) , defining value prop as primary objective. It might take a few months to get there, but be patient.

2. Whether it is a fixed fee, or a subscription model, platform costs will force you to tally the cost somewhere. You want to get clarity on ICP and value prop so that you can figure out how to offset those costs. 

3. Knowing your ICP and value prop will also help you understand how to deliver that value and the features you will need in a platform you choose. So again, without achieving (1) you might either pick an under performing platform or too complex a platform - both will have adverse effects on engaging your users.

4. When deciding a platform you want features that solve all your needs and also have features that will allow for features that will grow your community over the next 2-3 years.

5. (4) is important, else you will yank users from one platform to an underwhelming platform, and you will lose people along the way.

6. Pick a platform that is mature enough, that will allow integration of third party tools, automation etc cause basic processes like onboarding, exits, moderation etc, you want to be able to integrate with tools over time.

7. Dont be a guinea pig, at the expense of the users in your community, picking a platform that isnt tried and tested for reliability and scale.

23/01/24, 07:42 - +91 6355 762 814: Rabbit and Large Action Models are likely to be another watershed moment for AI - after ChatGPT / LLMs. In a way, their move to control hardware may be brilliant - to protect the LAMs. However, its hard to say what would be the long-term impact of such closed ecosystem. On one hand it does not seem to be positioned as a premium gadget (unliked iPhone is for the smartphone market), on the other hand its a category creator product.
23/01/24, 08:46 - +91 91503 09268: LAM seems to be Siri / Ok Google done right. I wonder how it will get past all those services which require proving we are humans üòÖ
23/01/24, 08:47 - +91 91503 09268: Jokes aside, the biggest value unlock will happen if and when we give these services financial freedom, but that will be a bit of a barrier.
23/01/24, 08:48 - +91 91503 09268: Virtual credit cards where you can load small amounts for LAMs to use might see a short term surge
23/01/24, 08:55 - +91 6355 762 814: that's a very interesting extension! Perhaps they open up an interface for eSign. If the key is plugged in, the rabbit is allowed to do certain tasks that require legal identity proof. Including creating documents - e.g. send offer letter to a new candidate.
23/01/24, 08:58 - +91 91503 09268: Problem is, most services are very careful with their APIs. From what I could tell in the demo, they said their model studies the interfaces and does a RPA (Robotic Process automation) maneuver to not use APIs but pretend like its another human using it (except for a few services where they seem to have integrated it).

How do you trust that this agent is working in your interest and not for the rabbit makers is the question üòÖ
23/01/24, 09:02 - +91 6355 762 814: They must put some guardrails, and make them transparent and configurable by the user. For example if they provide audit trail of all actions done by the agent, it's possible to determine if there's a selfish intent by the rabbit makers.
23/01/24, 09:03 - +91 91503 09268: üòÖ
23/01/24, 09:04 - +91 91503 09268: Imagine having a PA. And then at the end of the day, auditing every call, email, person the PA meets to make sure the PA isnt trying to kill you or skimming from the top. Not the best use of time
 üòÖ
23/01/24, 09:05 - +91 91503 09268: Anyways these things will evolve
23/01/24, 09:54 - +91 6355 762 814: üòÖ The assumption is that the transparency will force the makers to work in the interest of the customer. 
But yes, it may not be there from the beginning. Looking forward to the evolution!

As far as solving capabilities is concerned, chatgpt with wolfram plugin is giving accurate answer and chatgpt alone giving wrong answer
25/01/24, 20:15 - +91 88257 06312: Thanks KP will try it out
25/01/24, 21:06 - +91 6355 762 814: Ah - yes Wolfram plugin will make a difference here. Good to know that ChatGPT with Wolfram plugin is now able to visually understand these equations.

27/01/24, 13:23 - +91 73730 72285: Hi everyone,

I'm currently exploring different approaches for quickly building MVPs and I've been using Bubble.io. While it's working great, I'm finding the management of workflows a bit clunky, even with simple things like user management.

I'm curious if anyone here has experimented with generative coding tools, like GitHub Copilot or Replit. I'm interested to use templates and AI assisted coding solutions.

Personal experiences are welcome. Looking forward to your thoughts and experiences!
27/01/24, 13:25 - +91 6355 762 814: Don't have first hand experience, but have heard good reviews of GitHub Copilot from its users. Some teams have made it mandatory to use by devs.
27/01/24, 13:28 - +91 97910 22282: 10web.io

Ai assisted website builder.
27/01/24, 13:29 - +91 73730 72285: Did you use yourself or with a team? Can you share your experience
27/01/24, 13:33 - +91 97910 22282: I did a sample. It asks a series of questions on website type. 5 to 6. Short description and it builds it in no time.
27/01/24, 13:35 - +91 73730 72285: Okay it seems to be focussed only for content generation and websites. Not for MVPs.
27/01/24, 13:37 - +91 73730 72285: Other platforms can build full-stack applications.
27/01/24, 14:29 - +91 6355 762 814: McDermott also mentioned the benefits within their developers teams from AI code-generation. It‚Äôs unclear what developer innovation speed means (lines of code written? features shipped?) but even if it‚Äôs directionally accurate, the R&D cost savings for a business of ServiceNow‚Äôs scale should be significant.

‚ÄúServiceNow‚Äôs developers have been using text to code for several months. They are generating high-quality code using text to describe the type of code they won. This has increased our developer innovation speed by 52%.‚Äù

27/01/24, 15:23 - Muthukumaran Navaneethakr: Copilot is good for JS,Python & Java programmers , who have basic experience on what needs to be done , for others it might not be useful. (been using copilot from  2021 - beta days)
27/01/24, 15:29 - +91 88613 66628: Copilot is a tad expensive IMO. And it uses the  inferior gpt-3.5 in the backend. Like you said, it helped me in code completion initially but I was better off with some free VS code plugins beyond a point. 

Has someone tried aider.chat?? I see a lot of the tech podcasters use it
28/01/24, 18:13 - Aathiyam: Wow tried this tool it really good

29/01/24, 14:39 - +91 99498 14625: I‚Äôm curious as to how can one measure the developer innovation speed? Did someone try to do it in their teams? 

I too felt that the copilot thing is more helpful to the experienced team members and can at times be confusing even to them.
29/01/24, 14:39 - +91 99498 14625: Can be productive but with lot of caution.
29/01/24, 16:14 - +91 6355 762 814: Yes that was an excerpt from the tweet. 
With elaborate set up,  it is actually possible to measure developer productivity - not sure about "innovation speed" though üòÖ 
Tools like these are only going to get better over time, as more people use it and provide feedback.

30/01/24, 16:20 - +91 90030 79801: *An understanding of ChatGPT that I wanted to share:*

Question from a Beta User of lynclearn:  - AI (ChatGPT) is not considered reliable yet. It is known to make mistakes. How confident are you on teaching of your AI Tutor?

My Answer based on our testing and understanding of how LLMs are trained and work:

We tested on varied topics that we know of thoroughly - from Coding to Hypersonic motions. What we observe is, it didn't tell anything wrong in any of these topics. 

*How?*

Because the training dataset  (internet) has lot of data on the *concepts* (for coding or aeronautics or math or science). And mostly the data don't contradict on the concepts which are proven facts. It is trained well on the concepts with reinforcing data. So, it performs good in that aspect.
Where we have seen it failing is on some specific problems. We had experience in our earlier project (for K12) to get some MCQ questions and answers. When we get 10, it misses 1 or 2. 
That's because the training is not on that specific data. It made up some numbers and tried answering by itself and got it wrong. We are currently not going for specific problem solving in lynclearn. We plan to build some evaluation modules which could get that issue. We have to cross that bridge when it comes.
30/01/24, 16:21 - +91 90030 79801: This is my understanding. I'm open for any comments or discussions üôÇ

30/01/24, 22:14 - +91 97909 28555: Hi
In Chatgpt 4 API, if there are two users giving the same prompt to assistant ( playground) , can the two users get two different outputs? If yes, how do we ensure that we get the same output if using the same exact prompt
30/01/24, 22:17 - +91 95248 36909: from what I understand you will not get the same exact outputs but more similar ones.
30/01/24, 22:18 - +91 90030 79801: unless the outputs is like a binary or a defined finite set, this may not be possible.
30/01/24, 22:20 - +91 88613 66628: It is designed to not give repetitive output. There is a parameter
Called 'temperature' that controls the randomness of the output. If you want exact output , then cache once in a local DB and keep pulling it from there and not bother openai
30/01/24, 22:22 - +91 97909 28555: but there are some variables that keep on changing , but I need the basic headings or structure to be constant <This message was edited>

Since the model is very huge usually , there was always chances you may get different output , as its not a condition based answer rather a probablity based one. But since there is a rewarding mechanism associated with ChatGPT for every answer(like button) , the weightage will again change. But to put in non technical words , Yes there are chances for same prompts you may get different answers ,  To get exact answers you need to sharpen the prompts
04/02/24, 09:08 - +91 91503 09268: Anyone here who has switched to the Arc browser yet? Given that they are trying to essentially cut out the middle man of search engines using AI, i wonder how that would translate to content discovery in the long run.

04/02/24, 09:49 - +91 95248 36909: Registered for the waitlist
04/02/24, 18:59 - Muthukumaran Navaneethakr: Though Arc uses same the Chromium engine within, The User experience of browsing feels so ergonomic with it, There will be a bit of learning curve like moving from a normal keyboard to a ergonomic keyboard, But it's worth it.

Apart from it , It has the features of two of the greatest tools which I adore Obsidian and Excalidraw. Though it's embedded within Arc provides the same feel as those tools. Though most wouldn't feel that way, I would recommend everyone should try atleast for a week.

And Technically apart from Chrome Engine it uses Swift, Swift has been developed by the same guy(Graydon Hoare) who created Rust.
04/02/24, 19:01 - +91 91503 09268: Yeah it might not be worth building an engine from scratch, given how many projects there were and all had various issues rendering webpages - at the moment it is by enlarge chrome, safari or the fringe opera. And any new browser project, chrome is a good stablebase to start
04/02/24, 19:02 - +91 91503 09268: Theyve released some really cool features.

04/02/24, 19:41 - +91 6355 762 814: Interesting, the live folders would be quite useful. Rest of it looks like bard or perplexity.ai wrapped in a sleek browser interface.
04/02/24, 19:42 - +91 6355 762 814: I would be curious of their revenue model -clearly no ads without the middlemen
05/02/24, 08:00 - +91 91503 09268: I would think, with AI they know the intention in a far more nuanced way and instead of just giving traffic, they might be able to qualify and give leads.  Just like YouTube premium you might be able to pay 2$ a month and opt out. That model seems to be validated ar scale

Just wanted to know what kind of email automation tools are available which can trigger emails to customers after acquisition at various intervals after onboarding/ during the entire customer life lifecycle
08/02/24, 21:08 - +91 95248 36909: Any email autoresponder works like activecampaign, MailChimp or you can setup email automations in zapier or pabbly using your google account ( Business Gmail )

14/02/24, 12:47 - +91 95248 36909: yes
14/02/24, 12:47 - +91 99943 12306: yes
14/02/24, 12:48 - +91 97909 28555: It's asking for credit card details, does it deduct any minimum amount
14/02/24, 12:49 - +91 97909 28555: And free credits are actual free credits or do we have to spend some money to get the free credits
14/02/24, 12:49 - +91 97909 28555: Like they do in Google ads
14/02/24, 12:49 - +91 99943 12306: AWS is based on usage. but for the first 12 months it will be very less charges.
14/02/24, 12:50 - +91 99943 12306: It will be worth it
14/02/24, 12:50 - +91 95248 36909: There are free limits on AWS - it depends upon your consumption
14/02/24, 12:51 - +91 97909 28555: Ok. Which one is better , Google cloud or AWS

14/02/24, 12:52 - +91 95248 36909: what are you going to do with AWS or Google Cloud? Also personal opinion is that both are same and you can add Microsoft azure too but it totally depends upon which platform your developer is familiar with
14/02/24, 12:53 - +91 95660 17151: The decision of which cloud to opt is based on below pointers

- Which one is your tech team flexible with? 
- Are there are any specific use cases of yours? (This helps to decide which cloud, but more or less for most dev environments any cloud would do)

But first question is the most important for any startup
14/02/24, 12:53 - +91 97909 28555: We want to deploy open AI api
14/02/24, 12:54 - +91 95660 17151: That can be done on any cloud platform, its a simple API
14/02/24, 12:54 - +91 97909 28555: As of now we don't need it but AI developer insists on having AWS or Google cloud
14/02/24, 12:55 - +91 97909 28555: Is it necessary, can the API be deployed on cpanel directly? current shared server?
14/02/24, 12:55 - +91 97909 28555: So we don't need these cloud platforms right?
14/02/24, 13:03 - +91 95248 36909: The best solution would be to hire a Dev Consultant. Without knowing what you are building or what you are planning to build in detail it will be hard to suggest anything.
14/02/24, 13:04 - +91 95248 36909: Any platform like AWS, Google Cloud or Azure they will ask card details and you will be only charged when you use the services and in some cases they do provide a good free tier limit and you will be charged only when you cross the limit and be charged on the usage basis.
14/02/24, 13:05 - +91 95248 36909: they might charge small amount to verify the card
14/02/24, 20:11 - +91 98847 17148 joined from the community
14/02/24, 20:12 - Muthukumaran Navaneethakr: Yes we can deploy in Hetzner or Contabo vps with a docker compose and nginx. instead of opting cloud. only issue is your dev is aware of how to utilise it. The next layer would be to go for Vercel or Digital Ocean. It has a better free tier than cloud. But very soon it will start burning cash.
14/02/24, 20:13 - Muthukumaran Navaneethakr: If you plan to go for cloud provider opt for cloud native deployment solutions like usage of containers , so that you can switch providers , once they try to increase prices.

16/02/24, 06:11 - +91 88613 66628: Was just reading about this. This is not just image or text processing. They have unlocked a new dimension. This might involve fluid dynamics  and a lot of physics based simulation.
16/02/24, 06:11 - +91 90030 79801: they are killing it.
16/02/24, 06:12 - +91 90030 79801: their text-to-image is not that good imho. mid journey is still the leader..
16/02/24, 06:14 - +91 88613 66628: Possible. Their agenda is to achieve AGI via multimodality. They traded quality for more features. I still don't see anyone in their league to get multimodal AI working
16/02/24, 06:29 - +91 91503 09268: Isnt this a bad trade off? How do you build on things that are less than perfect? Even if i was using it for a simple customer interaction tool, if there was a 1% chance it might say something rude would make me weary - if they need to keep charging for the platform, they need to stabilize a few things right
16/02/24, 06:30 - +91 91503 09268: If you throw it math problems it makes horrible mistakes and justifies it üòÖ
16/02/24, 06:37 - +91 88613 66628: I meant this for openai as a company. Their product chatgpt is just the commercial wing. But their onus is on the core LLM development GPT4,5, etc. They have left it to others to work around their core model and perfect it to their needs. I found one of their developers say this in the discussion forum.
16/02/24, 06:38 - +91 88613 66628: I came across perplexity.ai recently. they self proclaim themselves as Google replacement. They are hell bent on reducing hallucinations by providing source of their data. And they use gpt4 in the backend.
16/02/24, 07:10 - +1 (646) 384-5354: You can provide your data, use retrieval methods (RAG) and limit the LLM to only answer from your corpus.  And ask the LLM to say it cannot answer if it can‚Äôt or transfer to a human (human in the loop).
16/02/24, 07:24 - +91 99444 92666: Their text to image is not reliable. Let me try this

this is going viral today. 
groq is lightning fast LLM App running OS LLMs and returning 400+tokens per sec. looks like they've designed their own chips with LPUs (Language Processing Units) instead of GPUs.

It has a special language model that you can use as a service or on a no-code platform. It looks very promising.

01/03/24, 14:18 - +91 91503 09268: There is a need to move beyond Information Tech (IT) to building capability and excellence in Operational Tech (OT). There is some limitations to how many interfaces we can create, forms we can build and data we can manipulate. In the future, where automation is inevitable, the interfaces between operations in the real world, and the introduction of tech to not just digitize but also streamline and automate is where value will get created.
